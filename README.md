# Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-Models

## Project Overview ##
This project involves the classification of images from the Intel Image Classification dataset using four deep learning models: AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. The performance of these models is compared to determine the best one for this task.

## Models Implemented ##
AlexNet
VGG16
ResNet50
InceptionV3

## Packages ##
TensorFlow
Keras
Matplotlib
Pandas
NumPy
ImageDataGenerator

## Performance Comparison ##
Based on the training and validation metrics, the Inception model was determined to be the best performing model. It achieved a final validation accuracy of 89.30% and a validation loss of 0.2923, outperforming the other models.

## Conclusion ##
The InceptionV3 model is the best performing model for the Intel Image Classification task in this project. It achieved the highest accuracy and the lowest validation loss on the validation set.
